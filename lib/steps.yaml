unite the theme at all widgets --
beutifiy it  --
make the incremental markers play controlable as in when you press a button it starts --

populate the db with real data
just add one real data and repeat it for a start --

make it into a website 
and put the key in another website (encrypted or otherwise) then retrive the key to read the database
or acess the db for an external api that's hosted in another service 

change the homeview : --
make it a row of one mapview and a coulmn that contains a control field and an optional location-adding-field --

add another github branch that will host the actual user app(filedview should be disabled & in it's place a webview/twitter should be placed) 

Ai and scraping off of twitter 
preleminary findings make it seem hard

add a slider for fun
